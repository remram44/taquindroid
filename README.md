The "taquin" is a sliding puzzle, also called 15 puzzle, game of 15, etc. The goal is to slide the tiles to reconstruct the original image, after they have been randomly shuffled. This app supports other sizes than 4x4 (which is the size that has 15 tiles).

You can load your own image into the game rather than use the provided one.

I wrote this a long time ago. While it runs on current devices, it should run on old Android versions as well (1.5+).
